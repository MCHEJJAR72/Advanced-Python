Grading Criteria
Criterion 1: Meeting Basic Requirements

0 pts: Student meets none or only a few of the requirements, doesn't understand the task.
1 pt: Student meets a majority of the requirements but shows some gaps.
2 pts: Student meets all requirements and demonstrates a good understanding of the task.
Criterion 2: Understanding of Coursework

0 pts: Student's code has multiple bugs, shows lack of understanding.
1 pt: Student's code has 3 or fewer bugs, shows some understanding but needs guidance.
2 pts: Student's code works correctly with 1 or fewer bugs, demonstrates complete understanding.
Extra Point for Extra Work

0 pts: Student did only the minimum required.
1 pt: Student went above and beyond, considered edge cases, handled errors, or did more than minimum requirements.
Example Scoring
Let's apply this to a hypothetical situation:

Criterion 1: The student turns in the assignment on time, has the correct file structure, and completes most tasks but misses a minor requirement. Score: 1 pt

Criterion 2: The code runs correctly but has 2 bugs, indicating some understanding but needing improvement. Score: 1 pt

Extra Point: The student anticipated potential issues, handled edge cases, and implemented error handling beyond the basic requirements. Score: 1 pt

Total Score: 1 (Criterion 1) + 1 (Criterion 2) + 1 (Extra Point) = 3 pts
